Make it look like the same as Facebook with animation
=================================

###This version had removed 5 original options:
- alwaysVisible
- disableFadeOut
- railVisible
- borderRadius
- railBorderRadius


###And added a new one:
- railSize: width in pixels of the scrollbar rail, make sure this value is greater than scrollbar size so the animation effect will work.

# What is slimScroll?

slimScroll is a small jQuery plugin that transforms any div into a scrollable area with a nice scrollbar - similar to the one Facebook and Google started using in their products recently. slimScroll doesn't occupy any visual space as it only appears on a user initiated mouse-over. User can drag the scrollbar or use mouse-wheel to change the scroll value.
